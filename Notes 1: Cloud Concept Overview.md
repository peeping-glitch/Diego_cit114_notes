## Notes 1: Cloud Concept overview
**A few key points can be listed:**

+ Scalability applications can be scaled automatically without having to mess with phyiscal hardware
+ Cost effective no more hardware so it means its actaually cheaper than having hardware and cuts spending of space for the hardware and electricty
+ Reliability no more worrying about outages since everything is off site and increasesd its avalibility to be hosted in multiple locations 
+  Data can now be accessable fro m virtually anywhere since everything is in the cloud 
+ Can replicate data to have multiple back ups
+ Faster up times when it come to realsing an application and service

**Quotes from readings and video in found intresting:**

The first quote i found intresting come from the reading **2.4 Goals and Benefits** and the quote is "By providing pools of IT resources, along with tools and technologies designed to leverage them collectively, clouds can instantly and dynamically allocate IT resources to cloud consumers, on-demand or via the cloud consumer's direct conﬁguration. This empowers cloud consumers to scale their cloud-based IT resources to accommodate processing ﬂuctuations and peaks automatically or manually. Similarly, cloud-based IT resources can be released (automatically or manually) as processing demands decrease". The reason i found this quote intresting is because of how it would take a long time to scale up when it come to hardware but with the cloud services you can easily scale up hardware to mitigate the downtime or get rid of it completly.

The Secound quote i found intresting come from a reading is from **2.2 Business Drivers** and the quote i found intresting is "A direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain. The growth of IT environments often corresponds to the assessment of their maximum usage requirements. This can make the support of new and expanded business automations an ever-increasing investment. Much of this required investment is funneled into infrastructure expansion because the usage potential of a given automation solution will always be limited by the processing power of its underlying infrastructure". The reason i founf this reading intresting is because it shows how the cloud can benefit companys reduce cost when it come to there infrastructure. The way it helps is by reducing the cost of implementing new hardware since all you have to set up is the power of you servers and have them running like nothing and no longer have to house the infastructure.

**Outlined facts**

The new facts i learned from this section is that the cloud can be cost effective when it comes to getting rid of hardware and the expensives that come with maintaining hardware and the other misc costs like electricity that come with maintaining hardware. Another fact i want to outline is the fact that this is accesible to anyone and will help smaller businesses get there operations running faster than we have done before. The Third fact i would like to outline is how data can be managed from anywhere in the world and so can the services. The fourth and final outlined fact i learned and would like to point out is the scalability of the cloud. You dont have to worry about downtime and replacing hardware for better hardware since you as the user of the cloud can adjust details and tailor the cloud services to your needs

**Questions remaining in my mind after reading this section**

One question i have left in my mind is how can we make this more ease of use to the public ? Another Question i have left lingering in my mind would be how much more can we do with the cloud? can we host ways to train ai without having to buy all the neccesary hardware to train your own?
