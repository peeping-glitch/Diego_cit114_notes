## Notes 09: Cloud Architecture

**Key Points**
+ Aws trusted advisor is a tool that provides real time guidance to provision your resources following aws BEST PRACTICES
+  Availability is defined as the percentage of time that a workload is available for use. Available for use means that it performs its agreed function when required.t
+ There are pillars to a well contstructured architecture are operational excellence, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability
+ One of the best practices that is identified in the AWS Well-Architected Framework is to plan for failure

**Identify 2 Quotes that are intresting**
+ A quote i found to be very intresting is actually the pillars to a well constructured cloud "Based on what we have learned, we have created the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which provides
a consistent set of best practices for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and provides a set
of questions you can use to evaluate how well an architecture is aligned to AWS best practices.
The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars â€” operational excellence, security, reliability,
performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability"(well-Architected Framework). THe reason i found this to be very intresting is actually because it helps identify how a cloud Architecture should be and the main focuses of one should just like a foundation of a house

+ Another quote i would like to point out is this one "One of the best practices that is identified in the AWS Well-Architected Framework is to plan for failure"(11.02, Reliability). The reason i would like to point this one is because nhon really prepares for a failure unitll it happens just like how we dont prepare for earthquakes until we get one and think about how we can prevent and get the best outcome from a failure

**Outline new facts that i learned from this section**

some new facts i have learned from this section is that we have to prepare for the worst in order to get the best outcome especially whenit come to having a cloud architecture juist because you doesnt mean you have it set up properly with a strong foundation. I also learned that AWS actually provide tools to help you build the best possible Architecture and how to manage it. They also provide tools to teach you the best practices. They try to help you with security and how to mitigate downtime


**What question remain after reading the section**
The question that reamin are how else can companies or people build a better foundation to build the best foundation they can since some people might not have the resourece or know how to build them? How can AWS or any cloud service help The DEVOPS teams set up these foundation from the start is ther something they can implement to start you off witha solid foundation?
