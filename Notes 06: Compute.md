## Notes 06: Compute

**Key Points**
+ AWS offers multiple operating systems for there services such as windows, macos and linux
+ The AWS Compute services have for biroad catagories and thoose catagories are virtual machines, Containers, Serverless, and Platform as a service
+ Virtual machines are configurable when it comes to how much proccessing power, ram, and storage you want to alocate to it
+ Containers is also offered on AWS they offer diffrent version of it such as Amazon Elastic Container, AMazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic container. A container is an instance-based and enable you to run multiple workloads on a single operating system (OS). Containers spin up more quickly than virtual machines, thus offering responsiveness. Container-based solutions continue to grow in popularity.
+  Virtual Machines have multiple reasons for use such as testing, running software in diffrent OSes, and running outdated software
+  Containers are kinda like virtual machines wher they create multiple instances to spread workload in times where it is needed and it also bundels the packages togethor to increase performance

**Identify 2 Quotes that are intresting**
+ One of the quottes that i found very intresting is Container in cloud computing is used to build blocks, which help in producing operational efficiency, version control, developer productivity and environmental consistency. Because of this, the user is assured of reliability, consistency, and quickness regardless of the distributed platform. The infrastructure is enhanced since it provides more control over the granular activities on resources. The container usage in online services benefits storage with cloud computing information security, availability and elasticity(8.11, What are containers). The reason i found this to be very intresting is because everyone use containers such as docker already to make applications more optimized and when something gets bombarded it helps spread workload to combat anybacklog and downtime.

+ Another quote i found to be very intresting is "Instance types vary in several ways, including: CPU type, CPU or core count, storage type, storage amount, memory amount, and network performance. The chart provides a high-level view of the different instance categories, and which instance type families and generation numbers fit into each category type. So if you compare a t3.large vs a t3.xlarge, you will see that the t3.xlarge has twice as much memory and vCPU as the t3.large."(8.07, EC2 Instancew Types). the reason i really liked this quote is because of how they made it easy for the user to choose what instance they want based on the thing they are trying to use that VM for such as a general purpose one or a storage based instance

**Outline new facts that i learned from this section**
Some new facts in learned in this section are that instead of calling the VMs being called virtual machines they are actually called instances and how they provide presets for certain tasks you may want to use an instance. I liked how they have an instance dedicated to something like machine learning which requires a lot of computing power. Another fact i liked is the use of containers they use containers are very useful to developers such as making an application more efficiant.

**What question remain after reading the section**
The question the i have with this section is can they impliment already existing containers for people coming off one container platform to AWS container platform?
