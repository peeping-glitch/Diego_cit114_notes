## Notes 02: Cloud Economics and Billing

**Key Points**
+ AWS uses a pay-as-you-go system so that you can easily adapt to business needs and as well as budget
+  Reserved Instances -you can save up to 75% over equivalent on-demand capacity
+  traditional infrastructure- are  datacenters, data storage, and other equipmentâ€”are all managed and owned by the business within their own facilities
+ On Demand -means you pay for compute or database capacity with no long-term commitments or upfront payments
+ AWS also offer service without charge but they do have there limitations and if exceded will have to pay for them so its easy to rack up a bill
+  Networking -Interconnected network components enable network operations, management, and communication between internal and external systems
+  Hardware - servers, datacenters, personal computers, routers, switches, and other equipment.

**Identify 2 Quotes that are intresting**
+ One quote i want to indentify is the pay as you go system "Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without over committing budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes. With a pay as you go model, you can adapt your business depending on need and not on forecasts, reducing the risk or over provisioning or missing capacity."(4.02,How do you pay for AWS?). The reason i found this to be very intresting is because it shows that the cloud can be cheaper method than traditional ways of hosting your own servers since you can adjust for what you want and for what you dont need later down the line
+ Another quote i would like to point out is cloud infrastrucure "Cloud infrastructure describes the components and resources needed for cloud computing. You can create a private cloud by building it yourself using resources dedicated solely to you. Or you can use a public cloud by renting cloud infrastructure from a cloud provider like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IBM, or Microsoft. And by incorporating some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across multiple clouds you can create a hybrid cloud."(4.07, What is IT infrastructure). The reason i am using this is because it points out how the cloud is just a service of something you can make just its a thrid party handling the stuff normal people would not like to handle like maintenance of servers or hardware

**Outline new facts that i learned from this section**

Some facts i learned from this section is that AWS uses a pay as you go system for payment which is really adjustable to any budget you wanna set and can increase as well with anything you want to add to it. I also learned that all the cloud is someone handling the hardware so you can take advantage of the services that come with hosting your own network. More facts i learned are that you can cut down on so much cost with going to the cloudsince now you dont have to get space for the network or pay the electricity or the upgrading of hardware every few years.


**What question remain after reading the section**

The Questions that remain after reading the section are how can you set up a diffrent hybrid cloud such as hosting certain services in hosue and certain services on the cloud?
