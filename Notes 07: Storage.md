## Notes 07: Storage

**Key Points**
+ There are multiples forms of storgae like ram, hardrives, ssd, nvmessd, thumbdrives, and floppy disks
+ DR-Disaster Recovery is a plan set up to have back ups of data you need to store in cas something happens to the main storage or system than you can revert to that back up and hopefully not lose any data
+ Replication is one of these cases of DR
+ RAID- a way to keep operation going even if you lose one drive the other can continue to work and operate perfectly work fine
+ NAS- netwrok attached stortage
+ Encrypting data- Encrypting data protects it from being able to be read if the transmission of the data was to be read
+ There are multiple ways to back up a system full/normal,, copy, incremental, differential, and daily 
+ Amazon S3 is a simple storage that uses buckets to store infomation or data you want keeping it off-site
  
**Identify 2 Quotes that are intresting**
+  A quote i found to be very intresting is the fact  that some company done even use on site back-ups or use them buit forget that they can be easily be taken or opened up and it also highlight the beenfits of having backups close at all times"An on-site backup is the kind that is physically kept at the business site, generally local storage. They can be a secondary hard drive, a USB drive, CD/DVD or some kind of RAID device. The keyword is that they are local and as a result will be the fastest to backup and the fastest to restore should something happen. The problem with on-site is that they can easily be stolen as well as destroyed with the rest of your business in the event of that disaster"(9.07, Backup Locations). Another reason i like this quote so much is because people forget how easy i can be to lose data.

+ Another quote that i found to be very intresting is "Data encryption while files are in transit is different that encryption at rest. When a file is in transit, you have two or more computers involved. The sender is the original system who encrypts the information being sent while the receiver are the systems that decrypt the information upon receipt"(9.05, Encrypting storage). The reason i find this to be very intresting is that when data is most vunerable is not when its in rest but when its in transit.

**Outline new facts that i learned from this section**
Some new facts i learned from this section are actually the types of backups you acan make like for example incremental back ups take small updates after taking a full copy of the system. Another Fact i would to talk about is catually RAID. I didnt know RAID can actually help read and write speeds while also protecting your data if one drive decides to go down. 


**What question remain after reading the section**
The Question i have remaining for this section is actually does AWS take backups of there systems and if so what kind of backups do they make and how frequent do they make them?
