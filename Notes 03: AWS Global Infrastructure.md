## Notes 03: AWS Global Infrastructure

**Key Points**
+ Cloud computing is IT resources over the internet
+ Replaces the need for buying and maintaing of hardware 
+ uses a pay as you go system 
+ can be used for gaming servers, website, emails, storage, and hosting of AI
+ implementation can be as fast as clicking some buttons and running your new service
+  able to shrink or expand capacity as you go or automatically
+  able to upload application in multiple locations all over the world

**Identify 2 Quotes that are intresting**
+ "An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region. There are currently 76 AZs, which are isolated locations— data centers — within a region. Each region has multiple AZs and when you design your infrastructure to have backups of data in other AZs you are building a very efficient model of resiliency, i.e. a core concept of cloud computing" (5.02). This is one of the quotes that i found very intresting since you can make it so your services are as optimized as they can be when it comes to be as close to the end user. It also can be used as to back up to multiple locations so you dont have to worry about any interuptions
+ the secound quote i found intresting is "First, AWS Infrastructure is elastic and scalable. This means resources can dynamically adjust to increases or decreases in capacity requirements. It can also rapidly adjust to accommodate growth.
Second, this infrastructure is fault tolerant, which means it has built-in component redundancy which enables it to continue operations despite a failed component.
Finally, it requires minimal to no human intervention, while providing high availability with minimal down time."(5.02). The reason i found this very intresting is it eleiminates the necesity for human interaction when something fails it gets tossed to another component that will not be broken. Also i found this very intresting because it adjust to the incoming growth

**Outline new facts that i learned from this section**

the new facts that i learned from this section are that these cloud services are everywhere all around the world and they will continue to expandas they are the future of how we set up new applications and software. Another fact i learned from this section is that you can host machine learning as well which is very cool as this will help smaller comapnys and people in general has acces to resources that are very expensive. Another fact i found very intresting is that you can upload an application to multiple locations to accomodate to the location of your user to grant them the besy experiance you can grant them as wll as being able to have multiple backups in multiple locations.

**What question remain after reading the section**

The question that i have for this section are what are other things you can host using the cloud services that where not mentioned in this section. Another question i have for this section is by hosting to multiple locations can you make an application diffrent based on what region they are accesing a services from and can those locations indivudually be changed to auto or manually scale?
